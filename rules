		<ul><li>No violence.</li>
		<li>No illegal substances.</li>
		<li>No discrimination of any kind or use of discriminatory language.</li>
		<li>Verbal back and forth / trash talk is acceptable but must be kept respectful. Avoid personal attacks.</li></ul>

		<h3 >General Rules</h3>
	</div>

	<div class="body">
	<ul><li>You must turn up on time for your matches at all stages in the tournament. If you are more than 5 minutes late you will forfeit the match and may be disqualified from the tournament.</li>

	<li>Bring your own controller. You alone are responsible for having your controller ready when you need to play tournament games.</li>

	<li>Games or sets are not to be replayed due to misunderstandings or misconceptions about the ruleset. It is the players' responsibility to be aware of the ruleset and/or to ask the Tournament Organiser's for clarification if necessary.</li>

	<li>Once a set has begun, the loser has 2 minutes to decide their stage/character choices and begin the next match. </li>

	<li>Coaching is allowed between games in a set, but not mid-game. If you are deemed to be coaching a player mid-game you will be asked to step away from the competitors.</li>

	<li>Collusion is strictly forbidden and players caught partaking in collusion, bracket manipulation, or any other activity harming the competitive integrity of the tournament may be disqualified and the player may lose all rights to any of the tournament prizes.</li>

	<li>Any disputes, or any other situation that is not explicitly detailed here but may cause issue or harm to the staff, the event, or the attendees will be dealt with at the discretion of the Tournament Organisers. </li>

		<h3>General Game Rules</h3>
	</div>
<div class="body">
	<ul>

	<li>Items off.</li>
	<li>4 Stocks, 8 minutes.</li>
	<li>No excessive stalling.</li>
	<li>If you wish you may invoke the Blind Pick or Neutral port Rules.
		<ul><li>Blind pick - Both players will tell a third party their characters for game 1, the third party will reveal to each player their opponent's choice, which they must stick to.</li>  

		<li>Neutral ports - Players must make use of controller ports which will ensure a neutral start (i.e both players spawn symmetrically). If you wish to invoke this rule it is your responsbility to know which ports lead to neutral starts for each stage.</li></ul>


	<li>If a match times out, the winner is determined by the remaining stocks, followed by lowest percentage. In the case of a tie with the same stocks and percentage, or a tie where both players die simultaneously*, a 1 stock rematch will be played on the same stage. *The suicide move rule is an exception to this.</li>

	<li>If each player has one stock remaining and the match ends due to a suicide move such as Kirby's inhale, Ganon's Side B (PM) then the player who initiated the move wins.</li>

	<li>Pausing is banned and results in a stock loss at your opponents discretion. In circumstances where pausing caused your opponent to lose a stock you may be required to sacrifice two stocks at the Tournament Organiser's discretion.</li>


	<li>Stock sharing is legal in doubles, controller swapping mid game (aka the grab 'n' go) is banned.</li>

	<li>You may not counterpick to ANY stage you have won on.</li>

	<li>The first stage is decided by banning from the starter stages in P1-P2-P2-P1 order. The player who gets to strike first may be decided by RPS/coin toss/etc.</li>	
	<li>Subsequent games will then follow this procedure:
	<ul><li>Winner bans stage (unless Bo5)</li>
	<li>Loser picks stage</li>
	<li>Winner chooses character</li>
	<li>Loser chooses character</li></ul></li>
