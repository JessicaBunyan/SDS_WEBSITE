			Team SDS is a collection of players and Tournament Organisers based in Southampton, UK. We started off as two players running small tournaments and have since grown into a huge team of dedicated players and organisers, who are passionate about improving the standard of tournaments in the UK. Our aim is to grow the Smash community and provide bigger and better tournaments, without sacrificing the relaxed and social atmosphere. With more than twenty successful events under our belts we now plan to expand and host events in more areas along the south coast and beyond.</p>
